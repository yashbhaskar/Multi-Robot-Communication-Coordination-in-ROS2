# Multi-Robot-Communication-Coordination-in-ROS2
This project demonstrates multi-robot communication and coordination in ROS 2 using Gazebo. It implements a leader-follower system, where one robot (leader) shares its position data, and the second robot (follower) follows it using ROS 2 topics, services, or actions.
